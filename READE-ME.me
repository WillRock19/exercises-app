## ðŸ“š Objective

> This repository was created so we could test different reactjs features with tests, build, deploy, containers, etc. The idea here is to create PR's with differet implementations. The first PR will show how to add react with webpack.js into a simple npm project. The second will show how to add typescript into the mix. Then, a third showing how to replace webpack for vitejs. We'll keep creating PR's as a way to store the changes made during development, aswell as serving as a map for future developers.
